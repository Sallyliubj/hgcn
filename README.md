Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks in PyTorch
==================================================

### Predicting Phylogenetic Trees Using Hyperbolic Convolutional Graph Neural Networks

The main training functions are implemented in `visualize.ipynb`

To train your own genomic data, need to upload your dataset to the `data` folder.

We obtained the dataset from [TreeBASE](https://www.treebase.org/treebase-web/search/treeSearch.html) 

In particular, these are [the 8 datasets we used for training](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vL12jLCGp5AwBt7ZNnzvYNV75P5ql_UL?usp=sharing)
