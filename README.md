Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks in PyTorch
==================================================

### Predicting Phylogenetic Trees Using Hyperbolic Convolutional Graph Neural Networks

The main training functions are implemented in `visualize.ipynb`

To train your own genomic data, need to upload your dataset to the `data` folder.
